#Jen's Itineraries


##Installation

Requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  To download Jekyll, make sure you have ruby gems installed and then in your terminal execute:

`gem install jekyll`

Jekyll will process files conforming to the directory and file structure described on Jekyll's site.

##Run Website Locally

With Jekyll installed, navigate your terminal to the root directory of the repo:

`cd path/to/folder/`

And start the local webserver:

`jekyll serve -w`

 The `-w` flag (stands for watch) will re-process files when they are changed.
